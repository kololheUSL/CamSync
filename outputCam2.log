*** CONFIGURING TRIGGER ***

Note that if the application / user software triggers faster than frame time, the trigger may be dropped / skipped by the camera.

If several frames are needed per trigger, a more reliable alternative for such case, is to use the multi-frame mode.


Hardware trigger chose ...
Trigger mode disabled...
Trigger selector set to frame start...
Trigger source set to hardware...
Trigger mode turned back on...
